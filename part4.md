  what is a situation where it is not appropriate?
-  MongoDB is appropriate when the data we are retrieving are high in volume.  It gives us better performance and is very flexible which makes it easier to scale.
- MongoDB is not very reliable. SQL is a structured language which is ACID
compliant  whereas MongoDB is not. Also, relational database makes it easier to connect different table with primary and foreign key, whereas MongoDB everything is dumped into one collection and retrieving is confusing as it is not structured.
